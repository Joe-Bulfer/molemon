Terminal based Pokemon game written in Go

In an attempt to learn Go, I will see how far I get with a text based adventure game starting in Littleroot town of the Kanto region. If the game grows enough, I will build a GUI around it using [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/). So far you can select a starter pokomon and travel to route 1 and back.
